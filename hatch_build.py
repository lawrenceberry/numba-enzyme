"""
Vendor the pre-built LLVM/Enzyme binaries into the wheel.

The derivative pipeline shells out to `clang`/`llvm-link`/`opt` from
LLVM 15 and loads the standalone Enzyme plugin, none of which are in
the source tree. `toolchain.py` looks for them under
`src/numba_enzyme/_vendor/` first, so a wheel built without that
directory installs cleanly and then fails at the first differentiation
unless the machine happens to carry LLVM 15 and a hand-built plugin on
`PATH`.

Two things populate `_vendor/`:

- Under cibuildwheel, `packaging/cibw_before_build.sh` stages binaries
  that `cibw_before_all.sh` built from source. That path is unchanged.
- Otherwise -- a `uv add`/`pip install` straight from a git checkout,
  which never runs cibuildwheel -- this hook downloads the released
  manylinux wheel from PyPI and reuses the binaries it already carries.
  That is the same trick `packaging/bootstrap_dev_toolchain.py` uses for
  editable checkouts, and it is what makes the git URL installable on
  its own. Set `NUMBA_ENZYME_VENDOR_FROM_PYPI=0` to suppress it and
  build a toolchain-less wheel deliberately.

A static `force-include` in pyproject.toml can't express any of this --
hatchling requires force-included files to exist unconditionally -- so
the entries are added here, once `_vendor/` is known to be present.

The released wheel keeps its shared libraries in a top-level
`numba_enzyme.libs/` written by `auditwheel repair`. They are staged
into `_vendor/lib/` rather than kept at that top-level name because
`$ORIGIN/../lib` is the first entry in the binaries' own RPATH, so the
layout resolves without shipping a directory that sits outside the
package.

The wheel is tagged `py3-none-linux_x86_64`. Everything under
`_vendor/` is a standalone executable or shared object rather than a
CPython extension, and the package has no extension modules at all, so
nothing here is ABI-specific and a CPython tag would only narrow which
interpreters can install it. An explicit platform tag also keeps
cibuildwheel happy: it refuses to hand an apparently-pure-Python wheel
(`py3-none-any`) to `auditwheel repair`, rejecting the build outright
("Build failed because a pure Python wheel was generated") before
auditwheel can rewrite the tag from the real contents. Discovered via a
real cibuildwheel run; local `auditwheel repair` testing never
exercised that gate, since it reads the declared tag rather than the
contents.
